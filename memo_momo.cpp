/*Memo and Momo are playing a game. Memo will choose a positive number a
, and Momo will choose a positive number b
.Your task is to tell them who will win according to the following rules:

If both a
 and b
 are divisible by k
, both of them win and you should print "Both".
If a
 is divisible by k
 but b
 isn't, Memo wins and you should print "Memo".
If b
 is divisible by k
 but a
 isn't, Momo wins and you should print "Momo".
If both a
 and b
 are not divisible by k
, no one wins and you should print "No One".*/
